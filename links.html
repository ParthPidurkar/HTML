        <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">markup language</a>  for documents designed 
            to be displayed in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser"> web browser</a>. It defines the content and structure of web content.
             It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting 
             languages such as JavaScript.</p>

                A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are often confused.[3][4]
                 A search engine is a website that provides links to other websites. However, to connect to a 
                 website's server and display its web pages, a user must have a web browser installed.[5] 
                 In some technical contexts, browsers are referred to as user agents.
